    "\n",
    "In this MVP-implementation, the QBART-team have prepared the following:\n",
    "- Three layers run on the FPGA: Thresholding, Fully Connected, and Convolution.\n",
    "- All the other layers run on the Cortex A9s through this notebook: pooling, minimax, and ??\n",
    "- We utilize little to no BRAM on the FPGA, as most IO is saved directly to DRAM, and we have no custom memory hierarchy for the FPGA, so memory performance is suboptimal.\n",
    "- We use the GTSRB-benchmark as the default in testing.\n",
    "- QBART can scale across several PYNQs via ethernet, yielding a linear speedup (speedup ~= Number of PYNQs/1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, let's get to it!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements:\n",
    "- A trained QNN that is constructed with layers.py in the QNN folder, then pickled with python2 to a pickle file.\n",
    "- This must be placed on the PYNQ, and you must edit the QNN path below so that QBART can find and work on it.\n",
    "- Image(s) must also be placed in a seperate folders, and you must set the image path accordingly.\n",
    "- You must also manually configure the configpart below, and setup static IPs for your additional PYNQs if you want to use distributed computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, with the requirements done, we do the following:\n",
    "1. Run all image classifications on QBART, and time it.\n",
    "2. Run all image classifications on a pure, correct CPU implementation, and time it.\n",
    "3. Check if both QBART and the CPU implementation agree. If both implementations agree on all image classifications, we know that the QBART implementation is correct.\n",
    "4. Present the results to the user."
