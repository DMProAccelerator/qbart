    "\n",
    "<img src=\"logo.png\",width=400,height=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this MVP-implementation, the QBART-team have prepared the following:\n",
    "- Two layers run on the FPGA (the actual accelerator): thresholding and fully connected. A padding unit is also available for the several layers.\n",
    "- All the other layers run on the Cortex A9s: pooling, convolution, sliding window.\n",
    "- We utilize little to no BRAM on the FPGA, as most IO is saved directly to DRAM, and we have no custom memory hierarchy for the FPGA, so memory performance is suboptimal.\n",
    "- We use the GTSRB-benchmark as the default in testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, it might not accelerate anything at all, so the MVP is more a proof of concept, while future iterations will actually make this faster than the actual implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, let's get to it!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements:\n",
    "- A trained QNN that is pickled and formatted similarly as the GTSRB benchmark.\n",
    "- This must be placed on the PYNQ, and you must edit the QNN path below so that QBART can find and work on it.\n",
    "- Image(s) must also be placed in a seperate folders, and you must set the image path accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, with the requirements done, we do the following:\n",
    "1. Run all image classifications on QBART, and time it.\n",
    "2. Run all image classifications on a pure, correct CPU implementation, and time it.\n",
    "3. Check if both QBART and the CPU implementation agree. If both implementations agree on all image classifications, we know that the QBART implementation is correct.\n",
    "4. Present the results to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO(N35N0M): Implement Yaman's GEMMBitserial as a separate CPU-based implementation. Does the common-case (matrix multiplication) very fast. We like fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO(N35N0M): Currently, it seems like at every run of the code, we create an additonal root logger. Fix the code so that it either checks for an existing logger at a new runthrough, or that we safely destruct all loggers before running again.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: We should specify how the input QNNs should be constructed, ask Yaman?\n",
    "Is nice to have if we actually want others to be able to use QBART later.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: Fix logger so that it actually works. Should be a helper file in qbart_helper."
